- Search! Most views have a search bar at the top (drag down to expose it)
- Improved app performace for users with large listening histories
- Fixed two of the top crashes in the app
- Listening history is saved instantly instead of at the halfway point of a track. (last.fm is still reported at the halfway point)
- Some of the views have had their backing UI rewritten. Everything should look the same, but please let us know about any bugs or differences you see in the show detail views.
- Updated a lot of code for latest version of Swift and iOS
