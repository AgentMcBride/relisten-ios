This build adds the start of State Restoration.  What does that mean for you?
 - If Relisten is killed in the background it should launch back to the same view you were in before it was killed. This means the app should always resume to the show you were viewing. 
 - Playback state isn't saved yet, but we're working on it!
 - State isn't restored if you manually quit the app. This makes it a bit difficult for you to intentionally test this feature (we're able to test it explicitly as developers, so I'm pretty confident in it working ðŸ˜€). Keep an eye out for Relisten launching to the main screen when you expected otherwise.
